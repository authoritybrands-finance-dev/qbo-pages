# 🧾 QuickBooks OAuth Integration – Full Technical Architecture & Rationale

## Overview

This document explains how we securely integrated **QuickBooks Online (QBO)** OAuth 2.0 authentication into our infrastructure *without* deploying or maintaining any custom servers. Instead, we architected a fully serverless solution using **GitHub Pages** and **Cloudflare Workers** — both free, scalable, and production-grade platforms.

The goal: build an Intuit-compliant OAuth flow that is secure, cost-effective, low-maintenance, and easy to use — especially for non-technical users such as franchisees or internal support staff.

## 🧩 A. The Problem: QuickBooks OAuth 2.0 Constraints

### ❗ OAuth Production Requirements (by Intuit)

QuickBooks Online apps must follow Intuit's OAuth 2.0 rules:

* ✅ OAuth Redirect URIs **must** be:

  * HTTPS-secured
  * Globally reachable on the public internet
* ❌ `http://localhost` and private IPs are **not allowed**
* ❌ Redirect URIs are manually reviewed and must **match exactly** what's registered

This creates friction in non-enterprise setups where spinning up scalable, secure infrastructure just for token exchange isn't feasible.

---

### ⚠️ Why Traditional Hosting Wasn’t an Option

We considered using a self-hosted environment (e.g., Hetzner bare-metal servers) but rejected it for several critical reasons:

| Challenge               | Explanation                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔐 TLS Management       | We'd need to manually generate, renew, and configure TLS certificates (e.g., via Let's Encrypt).                         |
| 🧯 Uptime Dependency    | If the redirect server goes down, users are blocked from authenticating.                                                 |
| 🌎 Public Accessibility | Hetzner instances don’t come with globally trusted HTTPS URLs out of the box.                                            |
| 🔐 Secret Handling      | Any redirect server that processes tokens must **never** expose `client_id` or `client_secret` to the browser or GitHub. |

Meanwhile, our **design goals** were:

* **\$0 cost** or close to it
* **No infrastructure maintenance**
* **High security and compliance**
* **Easy to use**, even for non-technical users

This required rethinking the entire OAuth flow architecture.

## 🧪 B. Our Architecture: GitHub Pages + Cloudflare Workers

We achieved a production-grade OAuth flow by decoupling the front-end redirect logic from the back-end token handling:

| Component          | Role                 | Platform           |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| 🔗 `redirect.html` | OAuth Redirect URI   | GitHub Pages       |
| 🔐 Token Exchange  | Secure backend logic | Cloudflare Workers |

This separation of concerns yields a **fully serverless**, secure, and Intuit-compliant solution.

## 🧱 C. Frontend: GitHub Pages for OAuth Redirect Pages

### 🔹 What is GitHub Pages?

[**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com) is a free static site hosting service provided by GitHub. It automatically serves HTML, CSS, JS, and image files over HTTPS from any public repository.

* Example GitHub Pages URL:
  `https://<org>.github.io/qbo-oauth/redirect.html`

### 🔐 Why Use GitHub Pages?

| Reason             | Benefit                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ HTTPS-Only       | Fully encrypted connections with globally trusted certs     |
| ✅ Zero Cost        | 100% free — no usage limits for static content              |
| ✅ Maintenance-Free | No patching, no containers, no NGINX                        |
| ✅ Compliant        | Meets Intuit’s requirement for a public, HTTPS redirect URI |
| ✅ Browser-Friendly | Secure sandbox for displaying clean status messages         |

---

### 📄 Files Hosted

We used three simple HTML files:

| File                  | Purpose                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `qbo-launch.html`     | Optional “start page” users click from (optional)        |
| `qbo-disconnect.html` | Optional success page after disconnection                |
| `redirect.html`       | The official OAuth Redirect URI (registered with Intuit) |

---

### 🛡️ Security Hardening (redirect.html)

This is where you shine — you added multiple defensive layers to **prevent OAuth token leakage**, a common mistake.

| Security Feature                | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` | Restricts all external requests except the one to our Cloudflare Worker. Prevents exfiltration to 3rd parties. |
| `Referrer-Policy`               | Blocks leaking of `code` or `realmId` in HTTP headers.                                                         |
| `history.replaceState`          | Scrubs sensitive OAuth query parameters (`code`, `realmId`) from the browser bar immediately.                  |
| Minimal UX                      | Page displays only a success message (no tokens, no debug info).                                               |

This ensures **maximum containment**: users never see tokens, and URLs are clean for screenshots, logs, and bookmarks.

## 🛠️ D. Backend: Cloudflare Workers for Secure Token Exchange

### 🔹 What are Cloudflare Workers?

[**Cloudflare Workers**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) are lightweight, serverless functions that run at Cloudflare’s global edge. You write JavaScript (or WASM) code, and it runs in a sandboxed environment — no container, no VM, no server.

* Public URL:
  `https://<service>.<account>.workers.dev/api/qbo/oauth/callback`

* Environment Secrets:

  * `QBO_CLIENT_ID`, `QBO_CLIENT_SECRET`, etc., are securely stored using `wrangler secret` CLI

### 🔐 Why Use Cloudflare Workers?

| Reason                | Explanation                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ HTTPS by Default    | Workers URLs use `workers.dev`, which Cloudflare automatically secures with HTTPS |
| ✅ Secret Isolation    | Secrets stored server-side via Wrangler, never exposed to users                   |
| ✅ Global Availability | Low latency from anywhere in the world — useful for distributed teams             |
| ✅ CORS Enforcement    | Rejects requests not coming from `github.io` origin                               |
| ✅ No Infra to Patch   | No VM, no container, no OS, no web server — just deploy and done                  |
| ✅ Free Tier Generous  | Millions of requests per month at no cost                                         |

### ⚙️ Responsibilities of the Worker

The Worker acts as a *secure exchange agent* between the frontend and the Intuit token endpoint:

1. **Accepts `POST` requests** from the GitHub Pages redirect page
2. **Validates origin** (CORS enforcement)
3. **Uses stored credentials** to authenticate with Intuit:

   * Exchanges `code` + `redirect_uri` for:

     * `access_token`
     * `refresh_token`
     * expiration metadata
4. **Responds securely** with token data to the front-end (or downstream API)

Optionally:

* Forwards token data to your server/db
* Stores in Cloudflare KV/D1 for persistent storage

## 📈 E. Future-Proofing and Scalability

You architected this with future enhancements in mind, without over-engineering:

| Feature                      | Purpose                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 **PKCE**                  | (Proof Key for Code Exchange) — enhances security for public clients by tying the token exchange to the original device/browser. |
| 🔐 **Signed `state` values** | HMAC or JWT signatures to prevent CSRF, hijack, or replay attacks.                                                               |
| 🗃️ **Token Persistence**    | You can store tokens in:                                                                                                         |

* Workers KV (Cloudflare’s global key-value store)
* Workers D1 (SQLite-compatible serverless DB)
* Downstream DBs (e.g., your MonsterTreePipeline SQLite instance)

None of these are required to get started, but all are viable later without re-architecting.

## 🧮 F. OAuth Flow: End-to-End Steps

1. **User clicks "Connect to QuickBooks"**

   * Button/link points to Intuit's authorization URL with `client_id`, scopes, etc.

2. **Intuit prompts the user to log in and authorize**

   * After approval, it redirects to:

     * `https://<org>.github.io/redirect.html?code=...&state=...&realmId=...`

3. **Redirect page (`redirect.html`) runs:**

   * Scrubs `code` from the URL using `history.replaceState`
   * Sends a `POST` to the Cloudflare Worker with:

     * `code`, `realmId`, `state`

4. **Cloudflare Worker receives request:**

   * Validates origin (CORS)
   * Uses stored `client_secret` to request tokens from Intuit

5. **Tokens returned securely:**

   * Worker responds to front-end or stores them downstream
   * Tokens include:

     * `access_token` (short-lived)
     * `refresh_token` (long-lived)
     * Expiration timestamps

6. **User sees: ✅ Connected**

   * The browser never stores, logs, or leaks tokens
